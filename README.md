^^^ is an app that sonifies images and serves as an aide in creating optical sound films.

It's compiled using Node-Webkit and nw-builder.

There are three executable builds (macOS 64-bit, Windows 32 and 64-bit) in the 'proto_imagetosound-nw/build' folder.

This app is in ongoing development. We're still working out some of the kinks in the interface, but it works perfectly overall.

Make sure to refer to the 'manual' PDF to learn how to properly use to the application.

Thanks!
