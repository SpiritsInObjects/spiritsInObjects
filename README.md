This is an app that sonifies images and visualizes sound as an aide in creating optical sound films.


### Dependenies

The application packages `ffmpeg` and `SoX` but requires the installation of `fluidsynth` to visualize MIDI files.

**Install on Mac**

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install fluid-synth
```

**Install on Linux (debian-based)**

```bash
apt install fluidsynth
```
